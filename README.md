# CVE clustering analysis.

This project is about a simple classification task on CVE using k-means. 
The data which collected from NVD database are metrics from the most recent CVEs about Microsoft's Windows 10.
Finally, the data are projected into the 2d-dimensional space using PCA in order to visualize the clusters.

## Usage
```console
user@pc:~$ python main.py --cve 100 #(e.g for the 100 most recent CVEs)
```
